# SIREN

This is an implementation of the paper "Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions" with the SIREN model. 
The code follows the implementation from the channel [Papers in 100 Lines of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT7ZhZjLBqM&ab_channel=Papersin100LinesofCode) with some refactoring of the code. 
I highly recommend this channel.
